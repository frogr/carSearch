# Car Searching

Hi everyone! This is a simple car search webapp that can be used to find cars on Craigslist and eBay. You can search using keywords, zip code, and select a radius in miles around the determined zip code. It'll return a table full of search results.

## Getting Started

This application is hosted on heroku [here.](http:http://carsearching.herokuapp.com)

If you'd like to download the code and run it on your own machine, check out the comment in script.js as you only have to uncomment some code to enable hosting through a local webserver (by default at 127.0.0.1:4000)

## Thanks!

I couldn't have created this alone, thanks to my developer friends for helping with guidance and assistance when I needed it, as well as the author of [node-craigslist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-craigslist) for his great tool and documentation, and the super easy-to-read-and-digest API docs from eBay.
